A personal project to create a blood glucose logbook app for diabetics or anyone else interested in tracking bg data.

I was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. I quickly became as informed as I could and began to track my glucose levels diligently.
I began to use a simple and affordable glucose meter and I quickly was left for wanting a better solution than spreadsheets and on device memory. 

Although there are established apps on the market, I enjoyed the idea of creating a project as my diabetic self as the user and client.

Work in progress. Criticism and advice are welcome.
